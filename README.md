# P7-Design-an-A-B-Test
This is the 7th and final project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I made design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommended whether or not to launch the change.
