**Funnel
-Homepage
-number of clicks/number of page views - click through rate
-unique visitors who click/uniquer visitors to page
-click through probability
-RATE -> USABILITY
-PROBABILITY -> IMPACT
```{r}
visitors <- 1000
unique.clicks <- 100
ctp <- unique.clicks/visitors
ctp
N <- 20
X <- 16
phat <- X/N
p <- phat
mean <- p
std.dev <- sqrt((p*(1-p))/N)

If we have a confidence interval of 95%, this means if we repeated the experiment several times we would expect the interval we construct around our sample mean to contain the true population mean 95% of the time.
```
binomial 
*1. 2 types of outcomes
*2. Independent events
*3. Identical distribution - p same for all
